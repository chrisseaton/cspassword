CSPassword, originally known as Password Safe, was a password manager that I
wrote as a young teenager over a decade ago. It was not written with any
knowledge of proper software development principles or cryptography, so I cannot
recommend that anyone uses it. However, I know that some people still have a
need to read CSPassword files so I am making the software available.  You should
only use CSPassord to migrate to a different password manager. Modern and
properly engineered alternatives include [1Password](https://1password.com) and
[GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org).
